# Hands-on Pipeline as Code with Jenkins

CI/CD Implementation for Mobile, Web, and Hybrid Applications Using Declarative Pipeline in Jenkins

This is the repository for [Hands-on Pipeline as Code with Jenkins](https://bpbonline.com/products/hands-on-pipeline-as-a-code-with-jenkins?_pos=1&_sid=71269e9a7&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications.

## About the Book
The main objective of the book is to create Declarative Pipeline for programming languages such as Java, Android, iOS, AngularJS, NodeJS, Flutter, Ionic Cordova, and .Net. The book starts by introducing all the areas which encompass the field of DevOps Practices. It covers definition of DevOps, DevOps history, benefits of DevOps culture, DevOps and Value Streams, DevOps practices, different Pipeline types such as Build Pipeline, Scripted Pipeline, Declarative Pipeline, and Blue Ocean. Each chapter focuses on Pipeline that includes Static Code Analysis using SonarQube or Lint tools, Unit tests, calculating code coverage, publishing unit tests and coverage reports, verifying the threshold of code coverage, creating build/package, and distributing package to a specific environment based on the type of programming language. The book will also teach you how to use different deployment distribution environments such as Azure App Services, Docker, Azure Container Services, Azure Kubernetes Service, and App Center.

By the end, you will be able to implement DevOps Practices using Jenkins effectively and efficiently.
